# Next-Type

Next-Type is a full-stack project built using **Expo** and **Next.js**, designed to work seamlessly across web and mobile platforms. This app provides a mobile-responsive experience with API access through Next.js, connected to a Postgres database using Drizzle ORM.

## Project Overview

- **Frontend:**
  - **Expo** for mobile-first development.
  - Works on both mobile and web platforms.
- **Backend:**
  - **Next.js** API for handling data requests.
- **Database:**
  - **Postgres** database integrated using **Drizzle ORM**.
- **Package Managers:**
  - **Expo App**: Currently using **npm**.
  - **Next.js Project**: Using **pnpm** for faster performance.
- **Planned Migration**: In the future, both the Expo and Next.js projects will be migrated to **pnpm**.

## Features

- Mobile-responsive design that works on web and mobile.
- API endpoints in Next.js connected to a Postgres database using Drizzle ORM.
- Current use case: **Farm Management** system, including:
  - Tracking farm revenues.
  - Tracking farm expenses.
  - More farm-related features to come.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (>= 14.x)
- **npm** (>= 6.x) or **pnpm** (>= 7.x)
- **Expo CLI** (>= 5.x)
- **Postgres Database**

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd next-type
```
#### 2. Install Dependencies
For the Next.js Project (using pnpm)
```bash
Copy code
cd nextjs
pnpm install
For the Expo App (using npm for now)
bash
Copy code
cd expo-app
npm install
```

#### 3. Running the Application
Running the Next.js API
```bash
Copy code
cd nextjs
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js API on http://localhost:3000.

Running the Expo App
bash
Copy code
cd expo-app
npm start
This will open Expo Developer Tools. You can either run the app on a simulator/emulator or scan the QR code to run it on a real device using Expo Go.

#### 4. Database Setup
Ensure your Postgres database is up and running.

Update the .env file in the nextjs directory with your database credentials and other necessary environment variables:

```bash
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_database_url
Drizzle ORM will handle the database schema and migrations. To run migrations:

bash
Copy code
cd nextjs
pnpm run drizzle:sync
```

#### 5. Additional Configuration
If needed, update the Expo appâ€™s .env file with API URLs and other necessary configuration.
The Expo app will consume the API provided by the Next.js backend.
Development Notes
Reinitialize Setup: In case you need to reset and start fresh, follow these steps:
```bash
Copy code
rm -rf node_modules
git clone <repository-url>
cd next-type && pnpm install && npm install
```

### Future Plans
-Migrate the Expo app to pnpm.
-Add more features for comprehensive farm management and tracking.
-Expand support for different devices and platforms.
